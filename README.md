# energy-management
A python-based automatic light energy management system to and control the energy usage of a designated room in a building via a raspberry pi.
The system:
- detects the presence of people using an infrared PIR sensor
- monitors energy usage of the lights by detecting the light levels of the room to distinguish artificial light from daylight
- save energy readings

### requirements:
see requirements.txt

### TODO
- [ ] display live light levels and readings
- [ ] predict the amount of future energy wastage/with and without using the system
- [ ] develop client-side user interface to view all of the data
- [ ] System evaluation
